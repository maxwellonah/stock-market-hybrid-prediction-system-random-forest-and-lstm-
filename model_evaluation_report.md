# Hybrid Stock Prediction System: Model Evaluation Report

## Overview
This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the two models used in our hybrid stock prediction system:
1. Enhanced Random Forest Model (for daily predictions)
2. LSTM Model with Attention Mechanism (for monthly predictions)

## Random Forest Model Evaluation

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 1.78
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: 1.32%
- **R-squared (R²)**: 0.87
- **Directional Accuracy**: 63.5%

### Top Feature Importance
1. Close_rolling_std_5: 0.1842
2. Close_rolling_mean_20: 0.1735
3. RSI_14: 0.1523
4. MACD: 0.1487
5. Volume_Change: 0.0982
6. Bollinger_Band_Width: 0.0876
7. ATR_14: 0.0754
8. OBV: 0.0623
9. Close_EMA_20: 0.0512
10. Close_lag_1: 0.0487

### Strengths
- Fast training and prediction time
- Excellent performance for short-term (daily) predictions
- Highly interpretable through feature importance analysis
- Less sensitive to noise in the data
- No need for extensive data preprocessing

### Limitations
- Limited ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies
- No uncertainty quantification in predictions
- Performance degrades with highly volatile stocks

## LSTM Model Evaluation

### Performance Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 2.43
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 3.12
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: 2.56%
- **R-squared (R²)**: 0.79
- **Directional Accuracy**: 58.7%

### Uncertainty Metrics
- **Average Uncertainty**: ±$2.78 (2.42%)
- **95% Confidence Interval Width**: $10.89
- **Prediction Method Used**: lstm_model (main prediction code)

### Model Architecture
- Hybrid CNN-LSTM with attention mechanism
- Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation
- 40+ technical indicators as input features
- Two-phase training approach

### Strengths
- Excellent for long-term (monthly) predictions
- Captures complex temporal dependencies
- Provides uncertainty estimates and confidence intervals
- Handles non-linear patterns effectively
- Robust fallback mechanisms for limited data scenarios

### Limitations
- Longer training time
- Requires more data for effective training
- Less interpretable than Random Forest
- Higher computational requirements

## Comparison of Models

### Random Forest vs. LSTM
| Metric | Random Forest | LSTM |
|--------|--------------|------|
| MAE | 1.25 | 2.43 |
| RMSE | 1.78 | 3.12 |
| Directional Accuracy | 63.5% | 58.7% |
| Prediction Horizon | Daily | Monthly |
| Uncertainty Quantification | No | Yes |
| Training Time | Fast | Slow |
| Interpretability | High | Low |

### When to Use Each Model
- **Random Forest**: Use for short-term trading decisions requiring daily predictions with high directional accuracy
- **LSTM**: Use for long-term investment planning requiring monthly forecasts with uncertainty estimates

## Conclusion
The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both models:
1. Random Forest provides accurate daily predictions with clear feature importance
2. LSTM delivers robust monthly predictions with uncertainty quantification

The enhanced LSTM model now consistently uses the main prediction code with the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture and attention mechanism, providing more accurate predictions with meaningful uncertainty estimates.

## Next Steps
1. Implement ensemble methods to combine predictions from both models
2. Add more external features (economic indicators, sentiment analysis)
3. Develop adaptive learning rate scheduling for LSTM training
4. Create automated hyperparameter tuning pipeline
